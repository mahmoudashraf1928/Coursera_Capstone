## Introduction/Business Problem

Accidents have widely increased in the last few ages. The presence of accident data makes us, Data Scientists, responsible for making studies and predicting future entries. This will help us predict the accident severity and know its causes.

## Data

Data are an essential element in making decision. We need to collect data that satisfy our researches and serve the desired results. We need to collect data about drivers, roads, times of accidents, business of routes, traffic status, and cars.

## Methodology

We will be analysing data in detail. 70% of the data will be considered as training data which will be used to make predictions, and the remaining 30% will be used in testing. Plots will be used to represent data and get results.

## Results

There's a complete relationship between the graphical representation of data and real results. The Predicted values show a great relation between the collected data.

## Conclusion

We can take many procedures to determine the accidents severity and reduce their percentage of occurence. The collected data will help us take these procedures according to the acheived results.
